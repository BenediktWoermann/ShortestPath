# ShortestPath

## Description

This Application visualizes how algorithms like Dijkstra and A* find the shortest path from a starting point to a target, if there are obstacles in between. Create your own world for the algorithm to work on it! Hopefully this app helps to understand path finding algorithms a bit more, without those confusing charts.

## Installation for Android

To Install the app, just search for the APK file in the root directory. You maybe have to deactivate the Play-Protect Services on your device.


## Features

1. **Visual Animations for better understanding**  
    Each step of the algorithm gets underlined by animating one block on the maze-field. So, you can better understand, how the different algorithms work and also compare them better. 
    
1. **Two different shortest-path-algorithms to choose from**  
    A* and Dijkstra are implemented till now.
    
1. **Create your own maze**  
    The whole environment for the pathfinding is defined by you. Target, starting point and walls can be placed where ever you want, so every scenario of interest can be created.
    
1. **Any borders? Your choice!**  
    Change, if the border of your screen is also the border of the maze, or if the environment is all the way open. If you decide for the open variant, the path is allowed to wrap around your walls offscreen.


## Edit the project

In order to open and edit the repository, you'll need to install Unity version 2019.1.7f1 first!
